# MAS4115_FinalProject

## Python Setup
The project has been configured to run from local Python files, using the given directory layout. If python is not locally installed on your computer, you can download and install it from here: https://www.anaconda.com/  

After installing Python, go into the Windows taskbar and search "Edit the system environment variables". Click on the "Environment Variables..." button. Then click on the Path row under System variables and click the Edit button. Add the following directories:  
> C:\ProgramData\anaconda3  
> C:\ProgramData\anaconda3\Scripts  


## Package installation
Then open the command prompt as an administrator and run the following:  
> pip install glfw  
> pip install PyOpenGL  
> pip install numpy  
> pip install PyGLM  
> pip install Pillow  


## Running the code
Visual Studio Code is a good editor to use for running Python and can be downloaded here: https://code.visualstudio.com/  
Once installing, open whatever directory the project is saved to in VS Code and select the conda interpreter at the bottom right of the screen. From there, if conda is selected and the packages have been properly installed, the Python scripts should be able to run properly.
